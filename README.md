Topic: The impact of e-commerce promotional discounts on consumer satisfaction

Background: The issue of the impact of discounts on consumer behavior has been studied by Western academics for a long time. As early as 1980, Della Bitta and Monro conducted a study on the impact of discounting on consumers. They concluded that consumers only pay attention to discounts when they are roughly 8.5% off, and that they perceive little change in the percentage of discounts when they vary between 50% and 70%. Do the same conclusions hold true for e-commerce platforms?

Hypothesis: The higher the price discount, the higher the consumer satisfaction

How: Online shopping generates a large amount of online review data, and online reviews can largely reflect consumer satisfaction. Therefore, I intend to analyze the content of these texts by using Bert, a language model, combined with manual markup. In addition, comparing the original price and the response of consumers with different discounts.
(P.S. The impact of false discounts, i.e., raising prices before discounting, on consumer shopping is not discussed here, and the impact of real discounts on consumers is discussed by default.)
